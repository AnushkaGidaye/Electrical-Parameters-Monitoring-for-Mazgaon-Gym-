# Electrical-Parameters-Monitoring-for-Mazgaon-Gym-
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor real-time electrical parameters including voltage, current, power, and energy consumption.

Created Power BI dashboard using real-time machine-level data from Amruta Presscomps to monitor key electrical parameters.

Visualized phase-wise voltage and current trends (VR1, VY1, VB1, AR1, AY1, AB1) with line .

Visualized temperature and humidity fluctuations according to time in a graph .

Built KPI cards and gauge charts to track Active Power, Reactive Power, Apparent Power, and Frequency against defined thresholds.

Implemented cumulative energy tracking (KwhAct1, KVah1) for real-time insights on consumption efficiency.

Added drill-through and filtering capabilities by time periods to support root cause analysis of voltage/current fluctuations.

Delivered actionable insights for the engineering team, helping in power quality monitoring, load balancing, and energy optimization.
